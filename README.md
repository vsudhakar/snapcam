# SnapCam
## A python app

### Here's what you need to get started.

* Install Python 2.x from www.python.org
* Install SimpleCV using the easy installer from www.simplecv.org
* Install the pyaudio library from https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

### How it works

There's nothing super awesome here, just navigate to the directory and run

```
	python capture.py
```

Pressing any key will end the video and audio, then merge the files. The default maximum runtime is 30 seconds, this can be adjusted in the file

```
	userSettings.py
```

Real simple stuff.

### Tips and Tricks

* This package has only been tested on Windows, Mac/Linux verification coming soon
* To quit, you have to press a key with the terminal in focus (click in the terminal box first)
